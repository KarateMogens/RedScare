# Red Scare!
_Algorithm Design, 2023_<br/>
_IT University of Copenhagen_

This folder contains the source code used to solve the _Red Scare!_ assignment. This project was created by Johannes Brown Porsgaard (jpor@itu.dk), Malte Helin Johnsen (mhej@itu.dk), and Nikolaj Munk Binder Jensen (nimj@itu.dk).

To recreate `results.txt`, run the script called `generate.sh` from the root folder of this project. It may be necessary to permit the script to execute, e.g. using `chmod +x generate.sh`. Running the program requires an installation of Python and assumes that the keyword `python3` is associated with it. If this is not the case, `python3` can be changed to e.g `python` in line 13 of the script.

The script will run the solution program once on every `.txt` file in the `/data/` directory. Any existing file named `results.txt` will be overwritten.
